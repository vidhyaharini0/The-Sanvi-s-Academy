      <h1> Student Visa Interview Preparation: Tips to Succeed</h1>

      <p>
        Your student visa interview is one of the final steps toward studying
        abroad. Making a confident, honest, and structured impression can help
        you secure approval from visa officers. Here’s how to prepare like a
        pro.

      <h2>🎯 What Is a Student Visa Interview?</h2>
      <p>
        The interview assesses whether you're a genuine student, financially
        capable, and planning to return after your studies. It typically lasts
        10–15 minutes and involves questions about your academic background,
        university choice, finances, and future plans.
