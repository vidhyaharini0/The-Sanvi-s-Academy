        Top Mistakes Students Make in Speaking Tests (IELTS | TOEFL | PTE)
      </h1>

      <p>
        The speaking test can be intimidating — but many students lose marks due
        to simple, avoidable mistakes. Whether it’s filler words, lack of
        structure, or poor fluency, knowing what to avoid can significantly
        boost your performance.
      </p>

      <h2>🚫 Common Mistakes Students Make</h2>

          and confidence.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Repeating phrases:</strong> Repeating the same point or
          vocabulary indicates weak language range.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Off-topic responses:</strong> Not answering the exact
          question asked lowers coherence.

        <li>
          <strong>Very short answers:</strong> You miss chances to show your
          grammar and vocabulary skills.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Overusing filler words:</strong> “Umm”, “like”, “you know”
          reduces clarity and professionalism.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Incorrect pronunciation or monotone tone:</strong> Affects
          intelligibility and listener engagement.

      </ul>

      <h2> Tips to Avoid These Mistakes</h2>
      <ul>

          smoothly within a fixed time.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Use a structure:</strong> For each answer, follow a
          pattern: <em>Point – Reason – Example – Result</em>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Improve vocabulary:</strong> Use topic-specific words to
          sound more fluent and confident.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Record and review:</strong> Identify your weak spots by
          listening to your own responses.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Listen to native content:</strong> Watch TED Talks,
          podcasts, and English interviews to absorb real-life speech rhythm.
