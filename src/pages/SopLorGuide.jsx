      <h1>📄 How to Write the Perfect SOP & LOR for Study Abroad</h1>

      <p>
        Applying to international universities? Your Statement of Purpose (SOP)
        and Letters of Recommendation (LORs) can make or break your application.
        They reflect your motivation, potential, and credibility — beyond your
        scores and transcripts.
      </p>

      <h2>✍️ What is an SOP?</h2>
      <p>
        A Statement of Purpose is a personal essay that explains why you’re
        applying to a particular course, your academic background, career goals,
        and how the program fits into your future.
      </p>

      <h3> SOP Must-Have Sections:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Introduction:</strong> Who you are and your motivation to
          apply
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Academic Background:</strong> Education and related
          achievements

      <h3>💡 Tips to Write a Winning SOP:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>🎯 Keep it clear, honest, and concise (usually 800–1000 words)</li>
        <li>🧠 Show passion and clarity of purpose — avoid generic lines</li>
        <li>
          🔍 Customize for each university — don’t send the same SOP everywhere
        </li>
        <li>💬 Avoid clichés like "since childhood" unless deeply relevant</li>
        <li>
          🔗 Use real-life examples to connect your goals and past experiences
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>👨‍🏫 What is an LOR?</h2>
      <p>
        A Letter of Recommendation is a formal letter written by a professor,

        <li>🏆 Real examples of problem-solving, teamwork, or innovation</li>

      </ul>

      <h3>📝 Types of LORs:</h3>
